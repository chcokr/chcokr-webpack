# chcokr-webpack

This fork of hjs-webpack used to be a horrible attempt of mine to come up with a
central supervising build system for all my webapps.
It is no longer maintained.
I now use
[chcokr-webapp-starter](https://github.com/chcokr/chcokr-webapp-starter) to
boilerplate and update my webapps.
